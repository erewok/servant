synopsis: Merge documentation from duplicate routes
packages: servant-docs
prs: #1241
issues: #1240

description: {

Servant supports defining the same route multiple times with different
content-types and result-types, but servant-docs was only documenting
the first of copy of such duplicated routes. It now combines the
documentation from all the copies.

Unfortunately, it is not yet possible for the documentation to specify
multiple status codes.
